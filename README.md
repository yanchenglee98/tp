# Hall-y

Hall-y is a hall residents' contact management application. It helps to keep track and update the residents' record, so the hall admin staff can easily find the residents based on the saved records.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
